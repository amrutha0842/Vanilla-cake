Whipp 4 eggs in a standard mixer for around 1 minute and then add 1.5 cups powdered sugar

Preheat the oven

While the eggs are whipping sift the 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1 tsp baking powder, twice.

Combine the melted butter and hot water in a cup and whisk together to mix.

Whip the eggs and sugar for about 15-20 minutes or until the batter ribbon falling off the whisk doesnâ€™t disappear for about 2-3 seconds. You want to make sure the eggs are properly whipped before continuing with the next steps for the successful rise of the cake in the oven.

Add 1 Tbsp of vanilla extract.

Now add the flour into the whipped eggs in halves, carefully folding with a spatula forming the number 8 with each stroke. Do not overfold or the cake will be tough. Just fold enough to incorporate the flour.

Add the melted butter mixture into the batter and carefully fold with a spatula until no streaks of liquid are seen.

Pour the batter into a 8 inch round cake pan (at least 2 inches tall).

Bake the cake for about 30 minutes on the middle rack of preheated to 350F oven. Check the cake with a toothpick/skewer by inserting it in the middle. If it comes out clean with no crumbs on it, the cake is ready to be removed from the oven. Remove it to a cooling rack and allow to sit undisturbed for 5-10 minutes. Then invert it onto a cooling rack and remove the foil. Allow to completely cool before using.

AND YOU'RE FINISHED! YAY!
